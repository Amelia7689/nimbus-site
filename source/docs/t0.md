title: Joining Nimbus Testnet0
---

This document is a very short guide on how to join our testnet. For a full explanation of what's going on behind the scenes, please see the official [announcement post](https://our.status.im/the-nimbus-mvp-testnet-is-here/).

## Joining Nimbus Testnet 0

Here is the full process if you're starting from scratch, without even Nim installed (you still need RocksDB though, so [install that first](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus#rocksdb)):

```bash
# Ensure you have rocksdb installed before running this!
git clone https://github.com/status-im/nimbus
cd nimbus
make update # this might take a few minutes
cd vendor/nim-beacon-chain # All Ethereum 2.0 functionality is in here
make testnet0
./build/testnet0_node # this launches the testnet0-specific node you just built
```

Here is the full process if you've already run testnet0 before but might be stuck with old source code or old, incompatible cache.

```bash
cd nimbus
make clean-testnet0 update # clean cache and update dependencies
cd vendor/nim-beacon-chain
make testnet0
./build/testnet0_node # this launches the testnet0-specific node you just built
```

Congratulations, you should now be joining us - your node will start syncing with the current state of our beacon chain. Once you're in sync, you should also start proposing your own blocks and providing attestations - exciting! You are now among [Ethereum 2.0 Nimbus pioneers](https://gitcoin.co/kudos/1160/nimbus_pilot)!
